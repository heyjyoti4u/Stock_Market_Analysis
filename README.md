# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analysis and prediction project focused on the stock prices of major tech companies: **Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG)**. This project uses Python, pandas, data visualization, and machine learning techniques to explore market trends and build a predictive model.
